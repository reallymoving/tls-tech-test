TLS PHP Developer Technical Test

## Welcome

PROJECT NAME: The Quiz

### The Background

It’s 2023, everyone is bored and that means they’re all taking part in quizzes. And quizzes don’t come any better than: The Quiz.

The MegaIDEAS Corporation has come up with a quiz file format they believe will be successful. One problem: they forgot to build a web site that delivers the quiz.

### The Test

Examine the example quiz file ``quiz.json``.

Use Laravel to provide a quiz frontend, taking the content of the ``quiz.json`` file and presenting the required quiz to those visiting the homepage.

Present the final score at the end of the test, along with a form allowing the player to submit their name and email address.

On successful submission of the final form:

  1. Store the result in a database
  1. Present a “High Scores” page, with scores ordered from the highest to the lowest


### Submission Requirements

There are a handful of essential requirements for any submission made:

  1. The submitted Laravel project must include the appropriate database migrations
  1. The quiz must start upon visiting the homepage (http://localhost:8001)
  1. You should name databases, tables - and style any pages - appropriately
  1. Submissions should be made either as a GitHub Pull Request, or by means of a link to another GitHub repository


### Important

Provide notes and feedback concerning any aspect of the test that you feel needs feedback or clarification, explaining any design decisions you made.

You may use any version of Laravel you are familiar/comfortable with, and any enabling technologies (such as Docker, or Laravel Sail) if desired. However the solution is provided, ensure it can be deployed and tested easily by those reviewing it.
